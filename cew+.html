        <h2>Career & Education Counseling: Our Mission</h2>
        <p>CEW+ assists hundreds of individuals each year as they make decisions about their future through free counseling that is open to everyone at U-M and in the community. Our comprehensive counseling program supports exploration of education and career interests within the context of relationships and life circumstances. Transitioning into the workforce or academia presents numerous unforeseen obstacles, especially for those with nontraditional backgrounds. Whether a student, a seasoned professional, or entry-level worker, our center offers a non-judgmental space where you will be individually advised. Our counselors work within a developmental framework to help individuals consider their options and make informed choices. CEW+ provides counseling to people of all genders and demographics and recognizes the complex societal factors that may present unique challenges in an individual’s life. We believe in overcoming challenges, and we believe in you.</p>
