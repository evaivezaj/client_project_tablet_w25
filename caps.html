            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and connect meaningfully with others. UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For information about UHS, please visit the UHS website.</p>

            <p>CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual services. </p>

        <h2>Treatment and Support Options</h2>
        <p>We're glad you are here! Your mental and emotional health is vitally important. We are here to support you in taking steps towards finding help for your concerns. At the University of Michigan, we recognize there is no “one size fits all” approach to supporting student mental health. That's why we provide a variety of options to meet a diversity of needs. Check out the options listed below to see what may be a good fit for you. Most of you know that individual counseling is one option -- but we know that not everyone wants or needs individual therapy with a professional -- so we've created other options which are noted below with a brief description to help you decide what route you may want to take. If you are not sure, please consult with us and we'll help you decide.</p>
